# XML-based chartcorrections

As requested during the HSSC 17 chair-group meeting, the materials related to XML- based charcorrections are archived by NIPWG within this repository.

XML-based chartcorrections are not actively developed anymore. The existing material that was produced, including UML, XSD, sample data etc. is collected into this repository folder and subfolders.
Meeting documents of the Workshop meetings are not added.

# XML Based NtM Chart Corrections Data Exchange (Whitepaper draft from 2018)

Hydrographic Offices produce charts in digital and printed formats.
The bulletins Notices to Mariners (NtM) are the medium to bring paper chart corrections to Marinersâ€™ attention.  They ensure that the chart used by the Mariner is up-to-date and reliable for conducting the intended voyage safely.  Paper chart corrections have to be done manually by the Mariner.

NtMs themselves are provided in digital and printed format.  The format and structure of the NtM are dependent on Hydrographic Offices design standards. 

Although the mariner is the primary NtM user, NtMs are also assessed by other Hydrographic Offices which either have interests in receiving updates to their own charts covering neighbouring sea areas or which have interest in providing a global chart coverage.

With the advent of digital chart production systems, and with the responsibility to provide and exchange NtM content in the future electronically, NIPWG (Nautical Information Provision Working Group) discussed the possible harmonisation of chart corrections in NtM in spring 2018.

All chart production systems currently employed by Hydrographic Offices have the capability to export data in XML format.  Thus, the request of a harmonised XML structure for NTM chart corrections was considered as most Hydrographic Offices plan to develop an XML based NTM chart correction export within the next two years.

XML is the commonly accepted programming language to exchange content with no style limits.  Consequently, it makes the direct import of external XML data into chart production systems possible.
Using XML also offers the widest possible flexibility for each Hydrographic Office to develop its own style of NtM chart information provision.  It prevents translation and interpretation errors and therefore, it increases the efficiency of data exchange and the reliability of information.

The primary purpose of the provided NtM XML structure is to enhance and simplify the NtM chart corrections between Hydrographic Offices.
